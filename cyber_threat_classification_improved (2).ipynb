        "## Abstract\n",
        "\n",
        "This project presents a structured machine learning pipeline for cyber threat detection using the **UNSW-NB15 network intrusion dataset**. The primary goal is to develop supervised classification models capable of identifying malicious network traffic and categorizing attack types based on flow-level features. Both **binary classification** (benign vs. malicious traffic) and **multi-class classification** (specific attack categories) are explored.\n",
        "\n",
        "The methodology emphasizes **data quality, reproducibility, and realistic evaluation**, incorporating extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, duplicate detection, and data leakage analysis. Multiple machine learning algorithms are trained and compared using cross-validation, with final performance assessed on a **completely unseen holdout dataset** to approximate real-world deployment conditions. Particular attention is paid to avoiding overly optimistic results by identifying dataset artifacts such as duplicated observations and by aligning evaluation metrics with cybersecurity objectives.\n",

        "### 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The rapid growth of networked systems and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks have exposed the limitations of traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems. Such systems struggle to adapt to evolving attack patterns and previously unseen threats. Machine learning techniques offer a promising alternative by learning statistical and behavioral patterns from network traffic data, enabling automated and adaptive threat detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project investigates the application of supervised machine learning models to network intrusion detection, with an emphasis on building models that not only achieve strong predictive performance but also **generalize reliably beyond the training data**. Ensuring robustness against data leakage, redundancy, and evaluation bias is treated as a central design goal rather than an afterthought.\n",

        "\n",
        "This project examined the use of supervised machine learning models for binary\n",
        "cyber threat classification using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, with a strong emphasis\n",
        "on recall-oriented evaluation and leakage-safe experimental design. The key\n",
        "findings are summarized below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Recall-Optimized Threat Detection**  \n",
        "   Among the evaluated models, Logistic Regression achieved the highest\n",
        "   cross-validated recall, making it the most effective model for minimizing\n",
        "   missed attacks. Although tree-based models such as Random Forest and Gradient\n",
        "   Boosting achieved marginally higher accuracy and AUC, they exhibited slightly\n",
        "   lower recall. Given the security-critical nature of intrusion detection, where\n",
        "   false negatives are particularly costly, Logistic Regression was selected as\n",
        "   the final model.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Meaningful Generalization to Unseen Data**  \n",
        "   The selected Logistic Regression model maintained strong recall and ROC–AUC\n",
        "   performance on a completely unseen holdout dataset. This confirms that the\n",
        "   learned decision boundary generalizes beyond the training data and is not the\n",
        "   result of overfitting or information leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Robust Experimental Design and Leakage Prevention**  \n",
        "   A strict preprocessing pipeline was implemented, including feature selection\n",
        "   performed exclusively on training data, reuse of training-time preprocessing\n",
        "   parameters, duplicate removal, and a 3+1 file validation strategy. These steps\n",
        "   ensured that performance estimates reflect genuine predictive capability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Sanity Check Validation**  \n",
        "   A label-shuffling sanity check was conducted to detect potential data leakage\n",
        "   or memorization. When training labels were randomly permuted, model AUC\n",
        "   dropped close to random levels while accuracy remained artificially high due to\n",
        "   class imbalance. This behavior confirms that the original model performance is\n",
        "   driven by meaningful signal rather than artifacts.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Interpretability and Stability**  \n",
        "   In addition to strong recall, Logistic Regression offers interpretability and\n",
        "   stable behavior under distribution shifts, making it a practical choice for\n",
        "   security applications where transparency and predictability are important.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Scope**  \n",
        "   Feature engineering relied primarily on manually designed features and\n",

        "\n",
